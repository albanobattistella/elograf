Elograf

This program is an utility for launching and configuring nerd-dictation for voice recognition.

Usage

With right click, the utility can be exited or configured.
The configuration dialogue contains a table list of all models which are installed on the system and which can be selected.
Models can be directly downloaded from alphacei website and stored either in the user or system space. For storing in the system space, root credentials are asked through polkit mechanism.
You can also select a directory where a model resides. You have to give it a unique name.
The configuration dialog is displayed if no model has been set previously.
